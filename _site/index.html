<h2 id="covit-covid-variant-tracker">CoViT (Covid Variant Tracker)</h2>

<p>This site tracks multiple different variants of COVID-19 in the U.S. (primarily B.1.1.7, which is the most prevalent). Our goal is to make this information publicly and easily accessible to study and understand the trends of COVID-19. Thanks to recent efforts of public labs, there has been an increase in sequencing data for this disease. This data is primarily stored in <a href="https://www.gisaid.org">GISAID</a> (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data). However, it is not easily accessible to the public and is difficult to understand. We use this data in tandem with our own statistical analysis to provide visual representations and graphs. More specifically, we present weekly updates to quantify the prevalence of COVID-19 variants (B.1.1.7) over time. In the future, we will create a model to predict the future trajectory of the B.1.1.7 variant.</p>

<p>We will measure the number of cases at each epiweek. The epiweek system is a standardized numbering of the weeks of 2021. For example, epiweek 12 are the days from 3/21/21-3/27/21.  Data from the most recent week may not be complete. Click here for the full <a href="https://ibis.health.state.nm.us/resource/MMWRWeekCalendar.html">epiweek calendar</a>.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-variant">What is a Variant?</h3>

<p>Like every RNA virus, the COVID-19 virus undergoes random mutations in the RNA, which encodes for its genetic and phenotypic properties. These mutated versions are known as <strong>variants</strong>. Some prove to be inconsequential and eventually die out. Others, however, can evolve to become more dangerous, which can be defined by three independent axis: virulence, transmissibility, and the ability to evade the immune response. Over the course of the pandemic, there are over 4,000 <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-03/uota-hus032321.php">COVID-19 variants</a> in the world. Once a variant emerges, the virus can pass on the same mutations to its descendants.</p>

<p>A <strong>variant</strong> only becomes a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/variant-surveillance/variant-info.html#Interest"><strong>variant of concern</strong></a> when it yields an increase in deaths or becomes more transmissible or resistant to the immune response.</p>
